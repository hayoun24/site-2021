## Description 

The Alliance Summer School in sustainable development is a student-led initiative of Columbia University within the [Alliance Program](https://alliance.columbia.edu/), a transatlantic partnership between Columbia University, École Polytechnique, Sciences Po, and Université Paris-I Panthéon-Sorbonne. 

This year's 5-day virtual program is geared toward graduate students in economics, environmental science, public policy, and related fields. Each day, the summer school will open with presentations by world-class researchers and policymakers who work on topics related to inequality and the environment; participants will then work in groups to develop a unique research proposal related to the theme. Students will also participate in practical workshops geared toward developing data analysis skills. The goal of the summer school is to bring together a diverse group of researchers for building research skills and developing connections for future research collaboration.

## Schedule

The summer school will be organized in 3 tracks: 

1. Distributional impacts of mitigation and adaptation policies
2. Unequal impacts of climate change
3. Unequal effects of environmental pollution and ecological degradation

**All participants will be able to attend lectures, keynotes and workshops from all tracks**, but independent work in small groups will be organized according to track interests. 

The following presents a tentative schedule of the summer school:
